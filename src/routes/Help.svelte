      Your aim is to guess the randomly chosen car in the fewest number of guesses
      possible. The number of remaining guesses is denoted by the dots near the top of the
      screen.
    </p>
    <p>Click on <strong>Select Car</strong> and submit a guess.</p>
    <p>The guessed fields will appear in red, yellow, or green.</p>
    <div class="grid grid-cols-[6ch_1fr] gap-2">
      <b class="text-neutral bg-rose-500 p-1">Red</b>
      <p>The field does not match the answer.</p>
      <b class="text-neutral bg-amber-500 p-1">Yellow</b>
      <p>The field is within a certain range of the answer, further denoted by â–² or â–¼.</p>
      <b class="text-neutral bg-emerald-500 p-1">Green</b>
      <p>The field matches the answer.</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      With 3 guesses remaining, a wild hint button appears! Hint can be used only once.
      Using the hint uses up a guess and reveals a randomly chosen field, so choose
      wisely. The car's name will not be revealed until the end however.
    </p>
    <p>If you manage to guess the car within 10 guesses, ðŸŽ‰!</p>
